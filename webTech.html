<p style="text-align: center;"><b>A client-server architecture is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between service providers, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
In a client-server architecture, a server is a program that provides services to one or more clients. A client is a program that requests services from a server. The client and server communicate over a network, such as the internet.

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="components">Components of Web Applications</h2>
<img src="img3.png" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Web applications are typically composed of several components that work together to deliver a seamless user experience. These components include.Web applications are apps that can be accessed using a web browser on the internet. There has been a constant rise in the development of web apps as they are better than native apps in some aspects. According to Forbes, they are easy to develop and update. Further, they also have faster download times probably due to the way web application architecture works
Being a leading web application development services provider, we have developed 50+ web apps for our clients. We also face constant inquiries related to web applications and their functioning. We decided to write this blog to tell you everything about the web app, its architecture, its types, and functions, and answer some frequently asked questions.</b></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"id= "webcon">Types of Web Content</h2>
<img src="img4.webp" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Web content refers to the information and media that is available on the World Wide Web. It includes text, images, videos, audio, and other multimedia elements that can be accessed through web browsers. Web content can be static or dynamic, and it is typically created using various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Static web content is fixed and does not change unless manually updated, while dynamic web content can change based on user interactions or other factors. Examples of web content include articles, blog posts, product descriptions, social media posts, and multimedia presentations.</b></p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="http">HTTP-HTTP Request</h2>
<img src="img5.png" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext via the internet. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
HTTP requests are made by clients (usually web browsers) to servers to request resources such as web pages, images, or other files. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which contains the requested resource or an error message if the resource is not found.</b></p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="dynamic">Dynamic WebPages</h2>
<img src="img6.png" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Dynamic web pages are web pages that can change their content and layout based on user interactions or other factors. Unlike static web pages, which display the same content to every user, dynamic web pages can generate different content for different users or at different times.
Dynamic web pages are typically created using server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Python, or Ruby, which allow developers to create web applications that can respond to user input and generate content on the fly. This makes dynamic web pages more interactive and engaging for users, as they can provide personalized experiences based on user preferences or behavior.</b></p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="server2">Application Servers</h2>
<img src="img7.webp" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Application servers are software platforms that provide an environment for running web applications. They handle the business logic and data processing required to generate dynamic web content. Application servers typically work in conjunction with web servers, which handle HTTP requests and serve static content.
Application servers can support various programming languages and frameworks, allowing developers to build and deploy web applications using their preferred technologies. They also provide features such as session management, security, and scalability, making it easier to develop and maintain complex web applications.</b></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="security">Web Security</h2>
<img src="img8.avif" alt="Web Technologies Image" style="width:50%;height:auto;align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Web security refers to the measures and practices taken to protect web applications and websites from various threats and vulnerabilities. It involves securing the data, applications, and infrastructure that make up a web application to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
Web security encompasses various aspects, including secure coding practices, authentication and authorization mechanisms, encryption of data in transit and at rest, and regular security testing and monitoring. It is essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of web applications and ensuring a safe user experience.</b></p>
